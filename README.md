Quantifying transit resources and its network wide spatial temporal distribution is needed for the informed transit planning and operations decisions.

Supply Index (SI) is a combination of indicators that measures the transit service resources allocated to a spatial zone. We have modelled the SI index between an origin destination pair that provides important insights on the supply provided for the mobility between two ends of the trip.

The formulation includes
a) zonal characteristics such as transit routes operates in origin zone, number of trips made by those routes in the analysis period, walk buffer areas of transit stops (number of transit stops), and total area of the zone.

b) the quality of the service provided.

c) origin-destination dependent variables such as the minimum number of transfers needed to travel from the origin zone to the destination zone, the average transit speed between those zones, straightness of transit routes, and total available capacity.

As the proof-of-the-concept, real Google Transit Feed Specifications (GTFS) data from Brisbane urban network is exploited to estimate the SI values for different origins to all other destinations (at Statistical Area level 2, SA2) at Brisbane, Australia.
